# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Finley Sherwood

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
In total I spent just over 10 hours working on this assignment, including these questions. Quite a lot of that was arguably in vain, considering I ended up restarting my main.py file right towards the end, but it did make it much faster and easier to rewrite cleaner and better practice code. Below is a table with the dates and times I spent working on this assignment.

| Date         | Start | End   | Total | Cumulative |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| 13th October | 6:30  | 7:24  | 0:54  | 0:54       |
| 13th October | 7:36  | 8:56  | 1:20  | 2:14       |
| 19th October | 11:35 | 12:50 | 1:15  | 3:29       |
| 20th October | 13:53 | 15:06 | 1:13  | 4:42       |
| 21st October | 8:32  | 10:55 | 2:23  | 7:05       |
| 25th October | 13:40 | 16:23 | 2:43  | 9:48       |
| 26th October | 18:56 | 19:33 | 0:37  | 10:25      |

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The part of the assignment I found most satisfying was the use of Place objects in the PlaceCollection list. Being able to access all relevant data on a place via a list is clean and simple, and definitely something I should put into practice more often in my code. I've done quite a lot of JavaScript, particularly with Discord bots, and I think that this type of concept could be very practical for that.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satisfied with the sorting system I made. There are a lot of parts being used and it is quite confusing for me to follow everything even though I'm the one that wrote it. Using a single return statement in a function is bad practice, and I'm sure there is an easier way to do it, but I unfortunately did not know this method. It also seems awkward to need to clear all widgets, sort the list, then regenerate the widgets every time anything changes in the GUI program, but for all I know that is the best method of achieving this result in Kivy.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Unlike past assignments I've done, whether it be at school or university, I've always been one of the people that leaves the assignment until the last minute - trying to finish it off within hours of submission time. This assignment I started nearly two weeks beforehand and gradually worked on it in small blocks of 1-3 hours. This meant it was less stressful, I had more time to think of better solutions to problems, and I didn't reach a point where I couldn't be bothered with making things better or improving less important parts of the assignment. For example, after finishing the assignment, I went through all the required files and put detailed commenting about what functions do and some of the more obscure lines of code to match that of some of the KivyDemos that were available to us.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Next time I have a project like this I should put the time into writing pseudocode before diving into the actual code itself. I found myself writing spaghetti code because plans would change and ideas would clash and it all resulted in a mess that was hard to read and understand. Instead of doing a draft-then-polished method involving the main_old.py and main.py, I could have written the pseudocode and built the final copy straight up.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Having done CP1401, I have quite a lot of practicals and documents explaining everything I needed to know for this assignment. I found it very useful being able to look at my past assignment and use my better Python knowledge to fix things up that I didn't know how to do well in the previous assignment. With all the practicals I've done over the past year, I have more than enough content to be able to solve the problems I faced when working on this assignment.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge I faced when working on this assignment was making the Kivy app functional, with the parts like sorting the widgets and the spinner. A lot of that came down to me not having enough knowledge of Kivy, but after going through the KivyDemos, all of the content was there so it was just a matter of rewriting those parts of the programs to match my use case.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Often people say that object-oriented programming is a plague on programming standards, but I believe this is a perfect example of where they are incredibly useful. If I were developing a Python project like this outside of the course, I would certainly be using these class methods like place.py. As I said earlier, I've done a decent amount of JavaScript in the past, but I haven't really bothered to learn much about classes, but having finished this assignment, I will be sure to make an attempt to use them in practical situations more often.
