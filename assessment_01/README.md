Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: **Finley Sherwood**  

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> In total the assignment took me approximately 2 hours 30mins to complete. I started 3/9 at midday and finished just after 2:30pm off the same day.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> For assignment 2, I will carefully read the task sheet, as I did not realise until after I had already thought I'd finished that I was supposed to sort the lines by visited and priority. Having a thorough read of the task sheet will mean I have a better understanding of the specific requirements beforehand and don't need to alt+tab back and forth checking every for information that I could have just read all at the start.
